# LForms Updater
This package is used to update an LForms form definition from one version of
LForms to the latest one.  It will also update FHIR resources created by LForms
to structures that would be generated by the current LForms package.

# Command-line Usage
    node bin/updater -f [path to form definition or FHIR resource file]

# Installation an npm package
    npm install lforms-updater

# Using the Package in a Program
    var updater = require('lforms-updater')
    var updatedResource = updater.update(formDeforResourceToBeUpdated);

The updater object contains a function "update" which takes the parsed JSON for
the form definition or resource.  The function also takes a second, optional
argument which is the version of lforms at which to stop updating.  (This was
useful for our tests.)
